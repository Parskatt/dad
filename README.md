## Run
```python
import dad
from PIL import Image
img_path = "assets/0015_A.jpg"
W, H = Image.open(img_path).size# your image shape,
detector = dad.load_DaD()
detections = detector.detect_from_path(
  img_path, 
  num_keypoints = 512,
  return_dense_probs=True)
detections["keypoints"] # 1 x 512 x 2, normalized coordinates of keypoints
detector.to_pixel_coords(detections["keypoints"], H, W)
detections["keypoint_probs"] # 1 x 512, probs of sampled keypoints
detections["dense_probs"] # 1 x H x W, probability map
```

## Visualize
```python
import dad
from dad.utils import visualize_keypoints
detector = dad.load_DaD()
img_path = "assets/0015_A.jpg"
vis_path = "vis/0015_A_dad.jpg"
visualize_keypoints(img_path, vis_path, detector, num_keypoints = 512)
```

## Install
Get uv
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
### In an existing env
Assuming you already have some env active:
```bash
uv pip install dad@git+https://github.com/Parskatt/dad.git
```
### As a project 
For dev, etc:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Parskatt/dad.git
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Evaluation
For to evaluate, e.g., DaD on ScanNet1500 with 512 keypoints, run
```bash
python experiments/benchmark.py --detector DaD --num_keypoints 512 --benchmark ScanNet1500
```
Note: leaving out num_keypoints will run the benchmark for all numbers of keypoints, i.e., [512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192].
### Third party detectors
We provide wrappers for a somewhat large set of previous detectors, 
```bash
python experiments/benchmark.py --help
```

## Training
To train our final model from the emergent light and dark detector, run
```bash
python experiments/repro_paper_results/distill.py
```
The emergent models come from running
```bash
python experiments/repro_paper_results/rl.py
```
Note however that the types of detectors that come from this type of training is stochastic, and you may need to do several runs to get a detector that matches our results.

## How I run experiments
(Note: You don't have to do this, it's just how I do it.)
At the start of a new day I typically run 
```bash
python new_day.py
```
This creates a new folder in experiments, e.g., `experiments/w11/monday`.
I then typically just copy the contents of a previous experiment, e.g.,
```bash
cp experiments/repro_paper_results/rl.py experiments/w11/monday/new-cool-hparams.py
```
Change whatever you want to change in `experiments/w11/monday/new-cool-hparams.py`.

Then run it with
```bash
python experiments/w11/monday/new-cool-hparams.py
```
This will be tracked in wandb as `w11-monday-new-cool-hparams` in the `DaD` project.

You might not want to track stuff, and perhaps display some debugstuff, then you can run instead as, which also won't log to wandb
```bash
DEBUG=1 python experiments/w11/monday/new-cool-hparams.py
```
